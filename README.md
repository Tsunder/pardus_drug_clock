# Pardus Drug Clock

An in-game clock showing drug usage and effects for use by pilots in Pardus (a MMORPG set in space).

## What is this?

This is a web extension that extends either Firefox or Chrome, adding a clock to track drug consumption within Pardus (a MMORPG set in space).

## What does it do?

The Drug Clock does not send any data anywhere - it counts when you use drugs (from a blocking building, combat or the nav screen) and displays how long you have until you are "clean" (no longer under the influence of drugs) as well as how drugged you are (which considers Trip Control and your Meditation level) when on the nav screen and on the logout screen.

## Why have you made it?

After the release of Firefox v57 (Quantum) and the changes required for existing userscripts, I decided to bypass the likes of TamperMonkey and Greasemonkey by bundling my userscript functionality into a native web extension.

## What am I supposed to do with it?

You can clone this repository and use the `build.sh` script to build the extension (for either Chrome, Firefox, or for both).

You might instead want to get the latest version from the following:

 * [Mozilla Addons - Pardus Drug Clock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pardus-drug-clock/) (Firefox)
 * [Chrome Store - Pardus Drug Clock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pardus-drug-clock/clncapanfphbkpplhodnmhbpjfdjkbok/) (Chrome)

And unless you are playing [Pardus - a MMORPG set in space](http://www.pardus.at/), then you will probably find this web extension of little use.
